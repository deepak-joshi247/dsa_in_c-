# c++ with DSA

 this contain all of my c++ work
this is the entry point of my works I have given below each sub-folder name with 
their content in further its blocks . 
1. sorting: I am discusssing some sorting question here
    {
        1.selection_sorting.cpp: 
        {
             I am solving a way to print the defined array
                in ascending order;
                it can be changed to descending by just making arr[i]<arr[j] instead of 
                arr[i]>arr[j];
                time complexity is O(n^2)
        }
        2.bubble_sort.cpp:
        {
                  a way to sort array by swapping its side element.
            condition of second for loop is still hard to understand.
            cont is used to break loop if array is sorted before full end to 
            decrease time complexity ( i.e. < O(n^2) ).
        }
    }
